# Minigames-2020

A collection of HTML, CSS, and Javascript minigames made in my grade 10th year at Mount Douglas Secondary School (2020).

## Hoshi
A single-player 2D RPG top-down style story game where you help collect stars to fulfil a child's wish.

## Pong
The classic game of Pong with sound effects and a twist: new special skills to improve gameplay. Played by two players on a single keyboard.

## Tic tac toe
Play tic tac toe on a sleek black-and-white UI against a simple bot.
